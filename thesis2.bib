  abstract    = {We perform error analyses explaining some previously mysterious phenomena arising in numerical computation of the Evans function, in particular (i) the advantage of centered coordinates for exterior product and related methods, and (ii) the unexpected stability of the (notoriously unstable) continuous orthogonalization method of Drury in the context of Evans function applications. The analysis in both cases centers around a numerical version of the gap lemma of Gardner--Zumbrun and Kapitula--Sandstede, giving uniform error estimates for apparently ill-posed projective boundary-value problems with asymptotically constant coefficients, so long as the rate of convergence of coefficients is greater than the "badness" of the boundary projections as measured by negative spectral gap. In the second case, we use also the simple but apparently previously unremarked observation that the Drury method is in fact (neutrally) stable when used to approximate an unstable subspace, so that continuous orthogonalization and the centered exterior product method are roughly equally well-conditioned as methods for Evans function approximation. The latter observation makes possible an extremely simple nonlinear boundary-value method for possible use in large-scale systems, extending ideas suggested by Sandstede. We suggest also a related linear method based on the conjugation lemma of M\'etivier--Zumbrun, an extension of the gap lemma mentioned above.},

  abstract  = {In this paper we investigate the implementation of the so-called freezing method for second order wave equations in one and several space dimensions. The method converts the given PDE into a partial differential algebraic equation which is then solved numerically. The reformulation aims at separating the motion of a solution into a co-moving frame and a profile which varies as little as possible. Numerical examples demonstrate the feasability of this approach for semilinear wave equations with sufficient damping. We treat the case of a traveling wave in one space dimension and of a rotating wave in two space dimensions. In addition, we investigate in arbitrary space dimensions the point spectrum and the essential spectrum of operators obtained by linearizing about the profile, and we indicate the consequences for the nonlinear stability of the wave.},

We prove that excited states of the NLS are not linearly stable in this more restrictive sense. We then give a partial proof that this more restrictive notion of linear stability is a necessary condition to have orbital stability."

  abstract = {We consider localized modes (discrete breathers) of the discrete nonlinear SchrÃ¶dinger equation i(dÏn/dt)=Ïn+1+Ïnâ1â2Ïn+Ï|Ïn|2Ïn, Ï=Â±1, nâZ. We study the diversity of the steady-state solutions of the form Ïn(t)=eiÏtvn and the intervals of the frequency, Ï, of their existence. The base for the analysis is provided by the anticontinuous limit (Ï negative and large enough) where all the solutions can be coded by the sequences of three symbols âââ, â0â and â+â. Using dynamical systems approach we show that this coding is valid for Ï<Ïâââ3.4533 and the point Ïâ is a point of accumulation of saddle-node bifurcations. Also we study other bifurcations of intrinsic localized modes which take place for Ï>Ïâ and give the complete table of them for the solutions with codes consisting of less than four symbols.},
